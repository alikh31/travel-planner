# Docker Container Runtime Fixes

## Issues Resolved

### 1. OpenSSL Compatibility Issues
**Problem**: Prisma was failing with OpenSSL compatibility warnings in Alpine Linux:
```
prisma:warn Prisma failed to detect the libssl/openssl version to use, and may not work as expected. Defaulting to "openssl-1.1.x".
```

**Solution**: 
- Added `openssl` package to both `deps` and `runner` stages in Dockerfile
- Set `OPENSSL_CONF=/dev/null` in docker-entrypoint.sh to bypass OpenSSL configuration issues

### 2. Database Path Configuration
**Problem**: Container was using `dev.db` instead of the configured `prod.db` path.

**Solution**:
- Explicitly set `DATABASE_URL="file:/app/data/prod.db"` in docker-entrypoint.sh if not provided
- Added environment variable verification and logging

### 3. Prisma Schema Engine JSON Parsing
**Problem**: Prisma schema engine was failing with JSON parsing errors:
```
Error: Could not parse schema engine response: SyntaxError: Unexpected token E in JSON at position 0
```

**Solution**:
- Added explicit `npx prisma generate` step before database operations
- Used `--skip-generate` flag on `prisma db push` to avoid regeneration conflicts
- Added proper error handling and fallback messages

### 4. Container Permissions
**Problem**: Database file permissions causing access issues.

**Solution**:
- Ensured proper ownership of `/app/data` directory (`nextjs:nodejs`)
- Added database file permission setting (`chmod 664`)
- Created data directory with proper permissions in entrypoint script

## Files Modified

1. **Dockerfile**:
   - Added `openssl` package installation in both build stages
   - Improved layer caching and security

2. **scripts/docker-entrypoint.sh**:
   - Complete rewrite with proper error handling
   - OpenSSL configuration bypass
   - Database URL verification and fallback
   - Prisma client generation and database initialization
   - Permission management

3. **run-docker-fixed.sh** (new):
   - Updated Docker run command with all environment variables
   - Proper volume mounting and port mapping
   - Container restart policy and logging

## Testing

Build the fixed image:
```bash
docker build -t travel-planner-fixed .
```

Run the container:
```bash
./run-docker-fixed.sh
```

The container should now start successfully without the previous OpenSSL and Prisma errors.
